# GUI Library

This is a high-level, object-oriented C++11 library for creating and using GUIs in an SFML 2.3.2 context, with an intuitive,
easy-to-use API. All classes have been made with ease-of-use in mind, allowing you to create as simple or complex objects as you need, without limiting you in any way.

Currently, the library has the following GUI elements included:
  - Icon
  - Mouse-Hover Message
  - Text Area
  - Text Pane
  - Button
  - Check Box
  - Progress Bar
  - Window
  - Text Field (WIP)
  - Slider (WIP)
  - Scrollable List (WIP)
  - Window Manager (WIP)
  
Example code demonstrating the usage of those classes not marked as WIP can be found under example in the master branch,
compileable and including the image and font resources used.
